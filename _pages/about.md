Thank you for visiting my personal web-page. My name is Mohamed Sami Rakha. Currently, I am a Ph.D. Candidate at School of Computing – Queen’s University. I have interest in software development, machine learning, data mining, and data visualization. You can take some time to view my publications.  Besides software development and research, I like bodybuilding, games, and, especially meeting new people. Please do not hesitate to contact to me in case of any question or replication data required!
